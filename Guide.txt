Just in case i switched.

So MVP is just MVC with contract, which has intrerfaces as the basis for the actual class implementation
Usually the data is stored in a form of accessible arrays (not directly edited to model like MVC)
Passing method is done by accessing their attribs directly (using Get or Set)

Routing is going to be a pain, make sure you understand the relationship between classes
Focus on the presenters, becuase that part specifically is a pain

To do:
add CRUD
show email and phone column
